This is a basic sentence in Markdown.

If I want italics, I use *asterisks*.

If I want boldfase, I use **double asterisks**.

# If I want BIG heading, I start the line with one number sign

## If I want a normal heading, I use two

### For a smaller heading, three

#### And so on

If I want a bulleted list, I leave a blank line and start with hyphens.

- Like this
- And this
- And that

For a numbered list, it's similar.

1. Like this
2. And this
3. And that

```{r}
2 + 2
```
